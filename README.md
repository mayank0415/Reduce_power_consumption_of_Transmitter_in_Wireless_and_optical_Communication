# Reduce_power_consumption_of_Transmitter_in_optical_Communication
I am working on an idea to reduce power consumption of transmitter in wireless and optical communication. 
I am saying that in optical communication we transmitting '0' and '1' logic. and to transmit logic '1' we have to send some power to represent logic '1'.
So, i build a algorithm to reduce no. of logic '1' in are transmitting sequence.
